# Project Status

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Server starts and loads Depth Pro model successfully
- ✅ Model runs on Apple Silicon GPU (MPS)
- ✅ Socket communication works (TCP on port 9995)
- ✅ Frame serialization/deserialization (pickle protocol)
- ✅ Depth inference working correctly
- ✅ Colormap visualization (Turbo colormap applied)
- ✅ Test client successfully sends and receives frames

### Files Created
- ✅ `config.yaml` - Configuration system
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- ✅ `depth_pro_server.py` - Main server (475 lines)
- ✅ `scriptTOP_depthpro.py` - TouchDesigner client (410 lines)
- ✅ `setup.sh` - Installation script
- ✅ `run_server.sh` - Server launcher
- ✅ `test_client.py` - Standalone test client
- ✅ `README.md` - Full documentation
- ✅ `QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide

## ⚠️ Not Yet Tested

### TouchDesigner Integration
- ⚠️ **Script TOP client not yet tested in actual TouchDesigner**
  - Code is written but needs live testing
  - May have minor issues with parameter setup
  - May need adjustments to subprocess management

### Syphon Output
- ⚠️ **Syphon code written but not tested**
  - Requires macOS and actual TouchDesigner
  - Should work based on pattern from other projects
  - May need minor fixes

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Dependencies
- opencv-python version pinned to 4.10.0.84 to work with numpy<2
- numpy must be <2.0 for depth-pro compatibility
- Some pip warnings about dependency conflicts (non-critical)

### Configuration
- Checkpoint path is hardcoded as `./checkpoints/depth_pro.pt`
- Created symlink: `checkpoints -> external/ml-depth-pro/checkpoints`
- This works but could be cleaner

### Logging
- Model prints verbose architecture on startup (can be suppressed)
- Log file location is fixed (could be configurable)

## 📝 Testing Results

### Test 1: Server Startup ✅
```
✅ Model loads in ~10 seconds
✅ Uses MPS device (Apple Silicon GPU)
✅ Creates socket server on localhost:9995
✅ Waits for connection
```

### Test 2: Frame Processing ✅
```
✅ Random 1024x1024 RGB image
✅ Sent via socket
✅ Processed through Depth Pro
✅ Returned colorized depth map
✅ Output saved as PNG (198KB)
✅ Processing time: ~10-15 seconds first run
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Production Use)
1. **Test in TouchDesigner**
   - Load scriptTOP_depthpro.py in actual TD
   - Test Active parameter toggle
   - Verify subprocess management works
   - Check frame format conversions

2. **Test Syphon Output** (if on macOS)
   - Verify Syphon server creates correctly
   - Test Syphon In TOP in TouchDesigner
   - Measure latency vs socket

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with different resolutions
   - Measure actual FPS (not just first frame)
   - Test frame dropping behavior
   - Monitor GPU memory usage

### Nice to Have
4. **Code Improvements**
   - Suppress verbose model logging
   - Make checkpoint path configurable
   - Add warmup progress indicator
   - Better error messages

5. **Documentation**
   - Add actual screenshots
   - Record demo video
   - Add troubleshooting examples
   - Performance benchmarks

6. **Features**
   - HTTP API for parameter control
   - Multiple client support
   - Real-time colormap switching
   - Depth map filtering

## 📊 Performance Expectations

Based on similar projects and Depth Pro benchmarks:

| Hardware | Resolution | Expected FPS |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| M1/M2 | 1024x1024 | 15-20 FPS |
| M1/M2 | 512x512 | 25-30 FPS |
| Intel Mac (CPU) | 1024x1024 | 2-5 FPS |
| Intel Mac (CPU) | 512x512 | 5-8 FPS |

**Note**: These are estimates. Actual performance needs to be measured.

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Testing
1. Start simple: Test with a static image first
2. Use test_client.py to verify server works
3. Then move to TouchDesigner
4. Start with low resolution (512x512)
5. Monitor `depth_pro_server.log` for errors

### For Deployment
1. Reduce log verbosity in production
2. Consider using config.yaml device selection
3. Monitor GPU memory (model uses ~4GB)
4. Use Syphon for lowest latency (macOS only)

## 🔧 Quick Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed Depth Pro API usage**
   - Changed from `model.forward()` to `model.infer()`
   - Removed unnecessary batch dimension
   - Added `f_px=None` parameter

2. **Fixed numpy/opencv compatibility**
   - Pinned opencv-python==4.10.0.84
   - Ensured numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0

3. **Created checkpoint symlink**
   - `ln -s external/ml-depth-pro/checkpoints checkpoints`

## 🎯 Current State

**The server host app is FUNCTIONAL but needs TouchDesigner testing.**

The core architecture is solid, the server works, and test results are positive. The main unknown is whether the TouchDesigner Script TOP integration works perfectly or needs minor adjustments.

## ✨ Summary

We've successfully built a working Depth Pro server following proven patterns from your other projects. The server:
- Loads and runs the model correctly
- Communicates via sockets
- Processes frames and returns depth maps
- Has comprehensive documentation

**Status: Beta - Ready for TouchDesigner testing**
